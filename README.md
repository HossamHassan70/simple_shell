# 0x16. C - Simple Shell
- Shell is a program that executes other programs in response to text commands.
- A sophisticated shell can also change the environment in which other programs execute by passing named variables.
- The type of shell, which may be customized for each user, is typically stored in the user's profile.
# C shell
- The C shell, csh, was modeled on the C programming language, including the control structures and the expression grammar.
- The C shell also introduced many features for interactive work, including the history and editing mechanisms, aliases,
    directory stacks, tilde notation, cdpath, job control and path hashing.
- Although the interactive features of csh have been copied to most other shells, the language structure has not been widely.
